In this simulation, we evaluate the performance of cross validation on penalized OKGT. Penalizing OKGT with respect to the capacity of the function space induced by a group structure is used in group structure selection. By incorporating the penalized OKGT in backward group structure selection, we attempt to ensure the consistency of group structure selection. Since the algorithm depends on two tuning parameters, $\mu$ and $a$, we use cross validation to choose a proper value for them.
