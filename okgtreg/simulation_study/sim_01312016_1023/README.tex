In this simulation study, we use 15 covariates and they are evenly partitioned into five groups. That is, the group structure $([1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15])$ is the true group structure. Each group is a log transformed mixed normal. So we have the following model for data generation:

Since each group of covariates follows a mixed multi-varaite normal distribution, the covariates $X$ are no longer independent.
