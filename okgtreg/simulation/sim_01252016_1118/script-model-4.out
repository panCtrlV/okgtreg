** Step 4 updated group structure is: ([1, 6], [2, 3], [4, 5]) 

** === Step 5 === **
** Create a new group: **
	 Create a new group for covariate 4 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3], [4], [5]) with capacity: 10
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9977036009
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

	 Create a new group for covariate 5 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3], [4], [5]) with capacity: 10
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9977036009
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

** Add to an existing group: **
	 try adding covariate 4 
	   in other group 1 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 4, 6], [2, 3], [5]) 
		 current group structure: ([1, 4, 6], [2, 3], [5]) with capacity: 32
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9976404688
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

	   in other group 2 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3, 4], [5]) 
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3, 4], [5]) with capacity: 32
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9976362808
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

	 try adding covariate 5 
	   in other group 1 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 5, 6], [2, 3], [4]) 
		 current group structure: ([1, 5, 6], [2, 3], [4]) with capacity: 32
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9976290765
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

	   in other group 2 ...
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3, 5], [4]) 
		 current group structure: ([1, 6], [2, 3, 5], [4]) with capacity: 32
		 current R2 (penalized) =	 0.9975710221
		 best R2 (penalized) =		 0.9980504844 

** Step 5 updated group structure is: ([1, 6], [2, 3], [4, 5]) 

** Finish with early termination at step 5 due to no further improvement of R2. ** 

** SELECTED GROUP STRUCTURE: ([1, 6], [2, 3], [4, 5]) with R2 (penalized) = 0.998050 **
