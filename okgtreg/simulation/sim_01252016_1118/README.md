# Simulation study

Including penalized $R^2$ in backward partition method to determine the best group structure for a data set.
 
We used the same 10 models used in "sim_01252016_1017".

For each model, 100 simulations are run, with 500 sample size for each time. 

The results for each model are saved as a dictionary where the Group object is the key, and the value of the penalized R^2 is the value.
